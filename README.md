# TL;DR


## The World Bank Group

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group)

The World Bank Group (WBG) (French: Groupe de la Banque mondiale)[6] is a family of five international organizations that make leveraged loans to developing countries. It is the largest and most well-known development bank in the world and is an observer at the United Nations Development Group.[7] The bank is based in Washington, D.C. and provided around $61 billion in loans and assistance to "developing" and transition countries in the 2014 fiscal year.[8] The bank's stated mission is to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity.[8] Total lending as of 2015 for the last 10 years through Development Policy Financing was approximately $117 billion.[9] Its five organizations are the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The first two are sometimes collectively referred to as the World Bank.

The World Bank's (the IBRD and IDA's) activities are focused on developing countries, in fields such as human development (e.g. education, health), agriculture and rural development (e.g. irrigation and rural services), environmental protection (e.g. pollution reduction, establishing and enforcing regulations), infrastructure (e.g. roads, urban regeneration, and electricity), large industrial construction projects, and governance (e.g. anti-corruption, legal institutions development). The IBRD and IDA provide loans at preferential rates to member countries, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Loans or grants for specific projects are often linked to wider policy changes in the sector or the country's economy as a whole. For example, a loan to improve coastal environmental management may be linked to development of new environmental institutions at national and local levels and the implementation of new regulations to limit pollution.[10]

## Goals of the Proof of Concept

The World Bank Group would like to build a proof of concept on Trusted Computring and Blockchain technologies to solve the following problems

- Data process of sensitive data without leaking using 3rd party infrastructure
- Trusted decentralized platform to track and monitoring the financial transactions in the 3rd world countries. 
- Low cost and decentralized ID to people in 3rd world countries
- Low cost, high performance and eco-friendly operation cost yet guarantee decentralization and security

## Solution overview

We proposed to build a PoC on top of existing Elastos blockchain as a layer-2 solution. The layer-2 is a trusted peer to peer network dirived from existing Elastos Carrier with extention on hardware guarded trusted computing technologies. 

Layer 1 (Elastos mainchain sidechain and smart contract) provide immutable ledger and smart contract logic. 

Layer 2 (Trusted computing enhanced peer 2 peer network) provide remote attestation, PoT (proof of Trust) consensus and local attestation on high performance PC to execute digital capsule. 

In the future, we will extend the layer 3 on top of the trusted peer to peer network, providing new PoET (proof of Elapsed Time) consensus and trusted smart contract runtime. 

## Technologies

Here is the [github link](http://github.com/elastos/WorldBankPOC) of this project

[Statement of work](https://github.com/elastos/WorldBankPOC/blob/master/doc/SOW-overview.md)

## Team

We plan to create a research team with engineers from The World Bank Group, Elastos, GMU (George Mason University) and other contributors from open source communities. 

The World Bank Group commit some engineers to join the team.

Angelos Stavrou [Web](http://cs.gmu.edu/~astavrou), expert of cyber security and  professor of GMU, would let his team to join the team as well.

We will need more contributors from the community to help build the PoC.

### Milestone

We are looking at the 3 months and 6 months milestone.

The SOW-01 is planned in 3 month. See Github for detail Statement of Work if the team can formed in time.

The SOW-02 and SOW-03 is planned in 6 months. See Github for detail Statement of Work. 

Demo day is set to 6 months.

### Deliverables

The whole project is open source. All source code and documents are online.

We are going to invite GMU CARE Cybersecurity center to do a security test when the demo is done. The report will  be part of the deliverables (cost unknown so far).
Dr. stavrou will also invite NIST researchers from the CSD and Crypto groups to test and validate the overall architecture using the NIST conformance laboratory.

Demo video will be online.

## Funding

We will need funding to support full time and part time developers and a few hardware cost.
