<p>
  While you see this page, obviously this is not a product page. This is for you, our developers.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this small preparation project is to example the logic between modules using simple node.js express code. Of course, it is not what the real product will use or looks like. 
</p>
<p> 
  In order to save time, I make everything quick and dirty... well, very dirty I know... The purpose is a better way to explain the biz logic, better than pre markdown documents, because you can try it in your machine and modify code to see the result immedaitely.
</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  Everyone may modify the code and commit without update this document. If you find some link does't work as expected, please go to check the code directly. And if you find this doc is out of date, please just update it. Sometime I update the code without update the doc. It is BAD behavior, I am sorry about it. thank you for your tolerance working with such a bad developer. if you do not, well , <b>send me some eggs</b>

  <h3>A list of things I did dirty and why</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All TPM communication is a placeholder. You can see "placeholder" everywhere</li>
    <li>When a node is hacked, I created with a "hacked" attribute so everyone know it is hacked. I wish in the real world, we can identify a hacked node this way</li>
    <li>You will need to manually trigger events using URL links below to simulate what happened in real world</li>
  </ul>
</p>
