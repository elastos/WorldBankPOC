# TL;DR


## The World Bank Group

## Goals of the Proof of Concept

The World Bank Group would like to build a proof of concept on Trusted Computring and Blockchain technologies to solve the following problems

- Data process of sensitive data without leaking using 3rd party infrastructure
- Trusted decentralized platform to track and monitoring the financial transactions in the 3rd world countries. 
- Low cost and decentralized ID to people in 3rd world countries
- Low cost, high performance and eco-friendly operation cost yet guarantee decentralization and security

## Solution overview

We proposed to build a PoC on top of existing Elastos blockchain as a layer-2 solution. The layer-2 is a trusted peer to peer network dirived from existing Elastos Carrier with extention on hardware guarded trusted computing technologies. 

Layer 1 (Elastos mainchain sidechain and smart contract) provide immutable ledger and smart contract logic. 

Layer 2 (Trusted computing enhanced peer 2 peer network) provide RoT (Roof of Trust), remote attestation, PoT (proof of Trust) consensus and local attestation on high performance PC to execute digital capsule. 

In the future, we will extend the layer 3 on top of the trusted peer to peer network, providing new PoET (proof of Elapsed Time) consensus and trusted smart contract runtime. 

## Technologies

Here is the [github link](http://github.com/elastos/WorldBankPOC) of this project

## Team

We plan to create a research team with engineers from The World Bank Group, Elastos, GMU (George Mason University) and other contributors from open source communities. 

The World Bank Group commit 4 + engineers to join the team.

Angolos Starouve, expert of cyber security and  professior of GMU, would let his team to join the team as well.

We will need more contributors from the community to help build the PoC.

### Milestone

We are looking at the 3 months and 6 months milestone.

The SOW-01 is planned in 3 month. See Github for detail Statement of Work if the team can formed in time.

The SOW-02 and SOW-03 is planned in 6 months. See Github for detail Statement of Work. 

Demo day is set to 6 months.

### Deliverables

The whole project is open source. All source code and documents are online.

We are going to invite GMU Cybersecurity center to do a security test when the demo is done. The report will  be part of the deliverables (cost unknown so far)

Demo video will be online.

## Funding

We will need funding to support full time and part time developers and a few hardware cost.
