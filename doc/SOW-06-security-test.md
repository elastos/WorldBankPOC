This is an ongoing task not the last task. We have GMU test lab and any opensource community to try out and try to break the system. We can get their feedback to improve our system.
One thing needs to mention, this system is not intent to be 100% hacker proof. It leverage blockchain philosophy that hacker needs to pay huge cost to break while get less benefit. So the economy design is very important, not only the technical design.
