Aug 1st 2019 to Dec 22nd 2019

# Goal

## Use
With the basic PoC demo we can easily and clearly explain the concept of trusted computing to potential investors or clients. Without this demo, we just have a slidesware on paper, and the concept is too new to explain to non-technical investors. This is the goal of this milestone

## Limitation
Due to limited budget and time constrains. We are not possible to complete a "solid" demo. I am OK with the following conpromise
- Placeholders are allowed for those key components which cannot completed. Such as SMM, VRF, PoET etc
- Developers can build their demo on any lanauge or platform they are familiar with, as long as keeping the communication protocol to work with other modules. 
- It is OK the demo modules not compatible with existing Elastos platform, as long as technically it can be compatible with Elastos platform.
- A simple UI is OK as long as it explains the concept under the hood
- Bugs even crashes are torleranced as long as they can be handled gracefully and not happening every seconds

# Demo Sceanarios

## Permissioned P2P network
* We start with 3 RPi P2P network running our node software. Prior to the demo, they have been set up and running nodes. They are considered the "Genesis Nodes".
* the 4th RPi want to join the network. The 4th RPi need to provide trusted information (Can be placeholder during development) to VRF selected verifier (VRF can be placeholder). 
*  To be continued
